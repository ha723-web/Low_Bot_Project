You're right, Harshini — the formatting in your GitHub `README.md` isn't rendering perfectly because of small issues like:

* Missing line breaks between sections
* Incorrect triple backticks for code blocks (should be \`\`\` without extra characters like `bash`)
* Folder structure shown inline instead of as a proper code block

---

### ✅ Here's the **correctly formatted** `README.md` to copy-paste:

```markdown
# Low_Bot_Project 🧠📄

This project automates the extraction and matching of copyright registration details from scanned document images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Extracts fields like Registration Number, Title, and Date from document images
- Uses OCR (Tesseract) and Python automation
- Processes multiple images in batch
- Outputs matched results to structured formats

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

Low\_Bot\_Project/
├── data/             # Raw input data
├── images/           # Input images for OCR
├── output/           # Matched outputs or logs

├── utils.py          # (Optional) Helper functions
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
└── Document.pdf      # Sample document / notes

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python ocr_matcher.py
```

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* Python
* Tesseract OCR
* Pillow / OpenCV
* Regex + String Matching

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add a Streamlit interface for user-friendly input
* Export matched fields to Excel/CSV
* Use layout-aware models like `LayoutLM` for higher accuracy
